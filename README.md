# Project Title
### Netflix Login Page
# Description
The Netflix Login Page project is a web development exercise aimed at replicating the login interface of the popular streaming service, Netflix, using HTML and CSS. This project showcases skills in front-end development, emphasizing layout design, styling, and responsive web design.
# Methodology
1. **HTML Structure**:

   The HTML portion of the project involved creating the structural elements of the login page, including the header, input fields for email and password, a sign-in button, and links for help and registration. Semantic HTML tags were used to ensure the code is well-organized and accessible.

2. **CSS Styling**:

   CSS was utilized to style the HTML elements, matching the design of the Netflix login page. This included setting background images, colors, fonts, and layout properties. Flexbox was used to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements were applied for interactive elements like hover effects on buttons and input focus states.

3. **Responsive Design**:

   Media queries were implemented to ensure the login page is fully responsive and provides a consistent user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
